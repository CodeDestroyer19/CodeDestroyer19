## About Me

I'm Mike Kiwalabye, a passionate programmer with 5 years of experience in web and desktop technology. I've worked on various projects, from building websites using platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Webflow, to developing applications from scratch. I'm fueled by my enthusiasm for programming, which I've pursued since the age of 16.

- üöÄ Python was my first programming love. I started with simple scripts for math homework and gradually moved on to building desktop applications.
- üíª JavaScript became my second love. Over the past 3.5 years, I've been using JavaScript daily for automating tasks and more. I started by creating a search engine and have since evolved into a Full Stack Developer with ambitions to disrupt the tech industry.
